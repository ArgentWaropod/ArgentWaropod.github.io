Astro Cell was one of the capstones for the 2021 class. A game where you and your friends have to either escape from a space prison, or keep the prisoners from escaping from the prison. Across the prison are various tools, items, and equipment, all designed to turn the warden's perfect little slice of paradise into a riot of a time. Hilarity ensues.

Astro Cell initially started as a game very similar to Among Us, where you have to perform tasks to progress in the game, while avoiding the guards trying to stop you. As development proceded, the game rapidly evolved into involving it's inventory system much more, and the game flourished into a very different beast. There was a lot of challenges when it comes to working with the Unity Multiplayer system, MLAPI, which caused the game to change. There were initially going to be mini games, but those ended up getting cut when the inventory and crafting became much more of a priority. Overall, it's a great show of how games can evolve throughout development.

As for my involvement, I was mostly involved with the creation of the Map. I designed the initial plans for the map, along with it's theming, design, and notable locations. I then modeled a tile set for the game, then textured and imported the models into Unity. Once the map was created, I then worked on the more than 40+ various props and items that exist throughout the prison. I also did work on UI elements, as well as the logo for the game.
