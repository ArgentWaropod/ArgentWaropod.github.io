Murder at Highmourn Manor is a game about trying to solve a murder. More importantly, it was my first attempt at creating a sprawling Dialogue system within Unity. I love games that have deep stories with plenty of characters to interact with, so I wanted to find a way to do that in Unity.

I achieved this by using Ink, a text editor designed to be used for storytelling, and the integration it has with unity. First I created the story using the Editor Inkle (and later the Unity built in editor), before implementing a Visual Novel-esque layout to enhance the gameplay. Ink is a surprisingly powerful tool for storytelling, as it's capable of logic gates, variables, and math that makes it it's own little programming language, and enhances any story you decide to write with it. Would highly reccomend.

Spoiler Alert: The Real murder was the friends we made along the way.
