Murder at Highmourn Manor is a game about trying to solve a murder. More importantly, it was my first attempt at creating a sprawling Dialogue system within Unity.
<br>
I achieved this by using Ink, a text editor designed to be used for storytelling, and the integration it has with unity. First I created the story using the Editor Inkle (and later the Unity built in editor), before implementing a Visual Novel-esque layout to enhance the gameplay.
<br>
Spoiler Alert: The Real murder was the friends we made along the way.
