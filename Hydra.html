Challenge of the Hydra showcases both one of my first VR projects, as well as my first fully modeled character, the Hydra. Challenge the monster, and see if you're worthy of the gods! Just remember, you got to burn off the heads to keep it dead!
<br>
There were a lot of interesting things that I experimented with when working with this project. The first of which is my first foray into particle effects for setting the spear on fire. This was done with a pre-fab from the Unity Store, but I loved the look of it all the same.
<br>
The Hydra was easily the most impressive part of the project. In addition to being an original asset, the Hydra has animations, models for when it's heads are cut off, and even a pre-planned personality for each of the heads. The beast is not just a mindless monster, but a beast of it's own.
