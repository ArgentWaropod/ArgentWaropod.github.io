title: "The first Grand Outline"

So, as a real important first post, I believe that I should be filling out the outline of what I want to do for my next project. I'm not 100% certain on when this project will be complete, it may be a project I work on whenever I have free time. But I want this to be my first independant solo project, not one done for school. But, I also don't want to go too crazy with a new game style, so I want to evolve upon a project I've done in the past. And when looking through what I did, one project stood out as the perfect place for an evolution.

Around spring 2020, I ended up making a project for Unity to test out hitboxes. It was a simple project. Two characters and messing with colliders to create hitboxes. It was an important project to learn as it would help me in later projects like [The Undesirables](/Undesirables/), but it always felt like it could be something more. So I decided that I'd work on a fighting game.

Real simple, eh?

The goal for this project is a simple 1V1 fighting game that plays similarly to Platform fighters (Simple Controls, greater focus on movement) with elements of traditional 2.5D fighters sprinkled in (Super Meters, Health Bars). The game will feature a relatively small roster of characters, but with a greater variety of character types (So fewer regular dudes, more weird choices). The roster will cover a variety of fighting game character archetypes (Balanced, Rushdown, Projectiles, ETC), and each will have a meter with unique moves and some general purpose tech options, such as a Combo-Breaker. Finally, there will be a few stages, with some being themed to a particular character.

Overall, a relatively simple concept, in the grand scheme of things. Now all I needed was a theme. Fortunately, I already had one in mind.

To the surprise of absolutely nobody, I'm a bit of a toy collector myself. I mostly stick to Transformers, but I dabble in everything from Gundam to Lego. It's a pretty fun hobby, and one that I think would make for a perfect fighting game. There's such a variety in what people make toys of that any single property has enough characters to make it's own solo fighting game out of. And since we're already taking cues out of Smash Bros, why not create a game that crosses over a bunch of characters from various series to create a fighting game out of. Obviously, I don't have the budget for the actual properties I'd be using for characters, but analogues to those franchises could still be pretty aproachable. Plus, the variety of the ways people interact with toys allows for varied characters, stages, and plot ideas. For example, in the Toy Story series, in just the first three movies, the films cover...

<ol>
<li>Toys owned by Children</li>
<li>Getting a new toy for a birthday</li>
<li>Toys getting replaced</li>
<li>Toys owned by kitbashers</li>
<li>Garage Sales</li>
<li>Toys getting broken</li>
<li>Toy Stores</li>
<li>Toys owned by Collectors</li>
<li>Growing up and giving your toys away</li>
<li>Toys owned by psychopathic children</li>
<li>Toys being given to new owners</li>
</ol>

And many, many more. That's not even counting the Shorts, the Fourth movie, or any material I missed. There's so much potential with toys as a concept that it's surprising a game like this wasn't thought up of already. Plus, everyone loves it when Darth Vader gets to fight a Furby. So I decided to try and create a hypotetical roster of characters for the fighting game, as well as some general archetypes they would fall under and any unique mechanics.

I only created it about a few days from when I created this post, and I already have 20 characters, grabbing from a variety of inspirations from Godzilla to Warhammer 40k to old cowboy toys to a real cat.

This would take some narrowing down. Fortunately, there's four characters that I think would help form a good baseline in terms of mechanics, variety, and theme.

<ol>
<li>Hero One: The Optimus Prime Expy. The solid all rounder with all the tools but none of the specialization. Perfect for beginners and experts alike.</li>
<li>The Red Queen: The Jurassic Park Rex. Big heavyweight that may get outranged, but if it gets in close, you'll be torn to shreds like the goat in the first movie.</li>
<li>Action Jack: The Technical, brick based building character. Can set up traps, has solid projectile work, and rides around in a giant mech made out of a truck. Awesome</li>
<li>Princess Autocra: A ruthless Disney Princess/Barbie analogue who will kick ass and combo you to low health before finishing you off despite being the "girly character".</li>
</ol>

These four I think will form the perfect baseline for characters in the game. They're varied, weird, and help establish the tone and style of future characters.

But with the design out of the way, it's time to focus on technicals. Thankfully, I know the seniors of NHTI's AGGP Class of 2020 did a fighting game, so I might be able to ask them for help if I ever need it, but there was something else that caught my eye. Unity's very own Universal Fighting Engine, a custom built system that's designed to help out with creating new fighting games in the Unity engine. It seems to be pretty strong and has already powered a few notable games before it. One problem: It's paid for, and I'm not sure what I have for a "budget", so to say. Maybe I'll try to make the engine myself, maybe I'll buy it and build the game off of it, we'll have to see where I'm at when I get around to that stage of the project.

So hope you enjoyed reading this, and I'll see you in six months when I've made notable progress on the game.
