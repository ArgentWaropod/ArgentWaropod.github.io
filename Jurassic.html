This project was the first full game I created while I was at NHTI. Harkening back to the park builders I grew up with, Don't Jurassic Up was a humorous take on the subject, with feeding Lawyers to Dinosaurs to getting scammed by fake scientists.

The main thing this project showcases is Serialization. Each of the events are a serialized object, which saved out to an XML file and is read by the game to provide the event system.
