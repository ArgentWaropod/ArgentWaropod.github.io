<H1>Don't Jurassic Up</H1>

Details:
<br>
System: Windows PC
<br>
Engine: Unity
<br>
Players: 1
<br>
Developed as part of NHTI's AGGP 101 Program
<br>
Controls: Shift to Summon Action Menu
<br>

This project was the first full game I created while I was at NHTI. Harkening back to the park builders I grew up with, Don't Jurassic Up was a humorous take on the subject, with feeding Lawyers to Dinosaurs to getting scammed by fake scientists.

<br>
The main thing this project showcases is Serialization. Each of the events are a serialized object, which saved out to an XML file and is read by the game to provide the event system.
