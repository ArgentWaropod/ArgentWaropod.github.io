This project was the first full game I created while I was at NHTI. Harkening back to the park builders I grew up with, Don't Jurassic Up was a humorous take on the subject, with feeding Lawyers to Dinosaurs to getting scammed by fake scientists.

The main thing this project showcases is Serialization. Each of the events are a serialized object, which saved out to an XML file and is read by the game to provide the event system. In hindsight, were I do the project again, I'd probably use Serialized objects, as that would save the hastle of having to edit a .xml file, especially since there were at least 13 different variables that each serialized event could contain. Still, that's what you get with first time projects. A lot of room for improvements. Everything else is the Unity classics. Variables, checks, booleans, and everything you need to make the dinosaurs and audience excited.

As my first project, I have a lot of fondness for it, but I can definitely see places where things could be improved, such as keeping the dinosaurs from breaking out of their cages in game, for one. Still, it's got a sense of humor (Inspired by the course professor) that makes it unique compared to the rest of the games here.
