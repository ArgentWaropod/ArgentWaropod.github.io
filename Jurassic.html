This project was the first full game I created while I was at NHTI. Harkening back to the park builders I grew up with, Don't Jurassic Up was a humorous take on the subject, with feeding Lawyers to Dinosaurs to getting scammed by fake scientists.

The main thing this project showcases is Serialization. Each of the events are a serialized object, which saved out to an XML file and is read by the game to provide the event system. In hindsight, were I do the project again, I'd probably use Serialized objects, as that would save the hastle of having to edit a .xml file. Still, that's what you get with first time projects. A lot of room for improvements.

As my first project, I have a lot of fondness for it, but I can definitely see places where things could be improved, such as keeping the dinosaurs from breaking out of their cages in game, for one.
