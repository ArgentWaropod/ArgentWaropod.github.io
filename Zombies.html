The Group 539 project isn't much of an impressive project, but more of a cautionary tale about making a complex game with systems you're unfamiliar with. The Group 539 Project was meant to be a room scale game where you fight zombies with gameplay similar to Call of Duty Zombies.
<br>
The problem is that the system I was using to create the game, Vuforia, ended up being a little trickier to work with than I anticipated. I initially created the game in Unity as a standard FPS, thinking that it would be easy to transfer the game over. It wasn't. There were a lot of bugs, glitches, and general problems that prevented the game from becoming what it was intended to be. So many cut pieces of content, like being able to buy extra health or upgrade your weapons never were able to see their true potential.
<br>
Still, the game's a good lesson learned. Just don't be surprised If I end up reverting it back to it's FPS roots.
