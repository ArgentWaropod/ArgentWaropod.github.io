This project was a group collaboration between other students. My contributions were the hitbox system for every character, background art, logo design, and the programming and art for the drone enemies.

The hitbox system uses Unity's collider scripts, but are tied to animation to have the hitboxes activate during the animation and tied to the 2D bone system. This allowed for pretty acurate hitboxes, as the game was inspired by Souls-like games. I also wrote the opening script to the game. S.P.I.T.E. is too good of an acronym to pass up. The enemies also have a state system that determines how the boss act.

This was also the first project to begin production during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, but not the last.
