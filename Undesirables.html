This project was a group collaboration between other students. My contributions were the hitbox system for every character, background art, logo design, and the programming and art for the drone enemies.
<br>
The hitbox system uses Unity's collider scripts, but are tied to animation to have the hitboxes activate during the animation and tied to the 2D bone system. I also wrote the opening script to the game. S.P.I.T.E. is too good of an acronym to pass up.
<br>
This was also the first project to begin production during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, but not the last.
